### Hello everyone! 👋

I am a Data Analyst with strong 10+ years marketing background in a Consumer Behaviour Analyst & Strategist roles and experience in creating data-driven strategic solutions for local and international brands. I am passionate about discovering genuine consumer needs behind numbers and statistics and leveraging data-proven insights to help businesses grow effectively.

👩‍💻 Due to my marketing strategist experience, I understand business needs and decompose them to clear goals, extract insights from raw data and create stories based on them, recommend data-informed solutions for brands to improve products on each funnel step, manage and unite different teams and know how to speak their language.    

👩🏻‍🎓 To enrich my knowledge and abilities, I took my skills to the next level by acquiring proficiency in SQL and Python programming. I completed an intensive 18-month Data Analyst Professional Training Course by @Yandex. During education, I went deep into exploratory data analysis, building dashboards in Tableau, business analytics and unit economics, statistical data analysis and fundamentals of machine learning.

- 🔭 I’m currently **looking for a job** as a Product/Marketing Analyst. My dream role is one where I could combine my programming and analytical skills with cross-functional experience in marketing, brand & product strategy, communication and data-based storytelling.  
- 🌱 I’m constantly getting more profound in my professional development and now learning deeper statistical aspects of data analysis and dashboard building in different BI instruments. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: at the university, I studied journalism and sociology and, for several years, worked as a reporter. I chose that path because I wanted to find and tell the world people's life stories. And, just like then, I believe that through understanding people's behaviour, the choices they make and the reasons standing behind them, we could make life better.

**My tech skills**:
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, TNS Mediascope (Galileo), TGI (DataFriend), IPSOS (Brand Pulse)
